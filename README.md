Coding Quiz

The project was completed along the guidelines for UCLA Extension's Module 3 Challenge.

The application deploys a quiz from the JavaScript file with an encoded key-value pair array. The main page deploys a highscore button to view past attempts and the highest scores of the quiz, a container containing the quiz questions and start and score submit button, and the timer for the quiz. 

Once the start button is clicked, the user has 20*(number of questions) seconds to complete the quiz. If the timer reaches 0 before completion, the quiz will end and the score will be calculated with the questions answered. For each incorrect answer, 15 seconds will be deducted from the total time. 

The quiz also displays an "correct" or "incorrect" text each time a question is answered.
